If you are new to programming in the Java language, have some experience with other languages, and are familiar with things
 like displaying text or graphics or performing simple calculations, this tutorial could be for you. It walks through how to 
 use the Java® 2 Platform software to create and run three common types of programs written for the Java platformapplications, 
 applets, and servlets.

You will learn how applications, applets, and servlets are similar and different, how to build a basic user interface that handles simple
 end user input, how to read data from and write data to files and databases, and how to send and receive data over the network. This tutorial
  is not comprehensive, but instead takes you on a straight and uncomplicated path through the more common programming features available in the 
  Java platform.
